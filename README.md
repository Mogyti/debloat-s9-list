# debloat-s9-list-rootless
[Prerequisites]
This list applies for SAMSUNG variants especially S9/S9+, may apply further for others SAMSUNG devices but use it for your risk.

## All bloatwares preinstalled by a vendor which are still being kept in RAM memory thus makes your phone slower. 
I decided to sort and used this list to remove those bloatwares. This guide aims at experienced Android users/ developers. 
## How to use:
1. Plug your phone in
2. `adb devices` to check for debugging connection
3. `adb shell` and paste the list above into the command line.
4. Profit!
